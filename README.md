Interchain query relayer implementation for [Neutron](https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron).

More on relayer in [neutron-docs](https://neutron-org.github.io/neutron-docs/relaying/icq-relayer)

# Running in development

### Natively

- export environment you need (e.g. `export $(grep -v '^#' .env.example | xargs)` note: change rpc addresses to actual)
- `make dev`

For more configuration parameters see [Environment section](#Environment).

### In Docker

1. Build docker image 
`make build-docker`
2. Run
`docker run --env-file .env.example -v $PWD/../neutron/data:/data -p 9999:9999 neutron-org/neutron-query-relayer`
   - note: this command uses relative path to mount keys, run this from root path of `neutron-query-relayer`
   - note: with local chains use `host.docker.internal` in `RELAYER_NEUTRON_CHAIN_RPC_ADDR` and `RELAYER_TARGET_CHAIN_RPC_ADDR` instead of `localhost`/`127.0.0.1`
   - note: on Linux machines it is necessary to pass --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway to Docker in order to make container able to access host network

# Testing

### Run unit tests

`$ make test`

### Testing with 2 neutron-chains (easier for development) via cli

#### prerequisites

Clone the following repositories to the same folder where the neutron-query-relayer folder is located:

1. `git clone git@github.com:neutron-org/neutron.git`
2. `git clone git@github.com:neutron-org/neutron-contracts.git`
3. `git clone git@github.com:neutron-org/neutron-integration-tests.git` for testing using docker

#### terminal 1

1. `cd neutron`
2. `make build && make init && make start-rly`

#### terminal 2

1. `cd neutron-contracts`
2. run test_*.sh files from the root of the neutron-contracts project (e.g. `./test_tx_query_result.sh`).

#### terminal 3

1. copy `.env.example` and rename the copy to `.env`
2. set env from env list via way you prefer and run relayer:

`export $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs) && make dev`

### Testing via docker

1. `cd neutron-integration-tests`
2. read and run preparation steps described in the README.md file
3. run tests as described in the README.md file

In case of unexpected behaviour (e.g. tests failure) you can inspect neutron and relayer logs by doing the following:

Neutron:

1. `docker ps`
2. find the neutron container id
3. `docker exec -it neutron_id bash`
4. `cd /opt/neutron/data`
5. observe neutron logs in file `test-1.log`

Relayer:

1. `docker ps`
2. find the relayer container id
3. `docker logs -f relayer_id`

# Logging

We are using a little bit modified [zap.Logger](https://github.com/uber-go/zap), the modification can be seen at the [neutron-logger repository](https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron-logger). The default version of the logger used in the application is a little bit modified [zap.NewProduction](https://github.com/uber-go/zap/blob/master/logger.go#L94). The logger level can be set via the `LOGGER_LEVEL` env variable. If there is a need for a more significant customisation of the logger behaviour, see the neutron-logger repository readme.

## Generate Openapi

The relayer uses a generated swagger client to retrieve queries information from Neutron. You can re-generate the Go
client from `./internal/subscriber/querier/openapi.yml` by running:

```
make generate-openapi
```

The swagger specs can be taken from the Neutron [repo](https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron/blob/main/docs/static/openapi.yml) (you need to remove most of the generated specification).
